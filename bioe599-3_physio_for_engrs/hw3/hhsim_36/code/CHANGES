3.6:

 'ans' can no longer be used as a local variable name (find_dV)
 str_get is being called with one argument, not two (how did this ever work?)
 reset_memparams.m shouldn't reset the Rm parameter since it has no valinit

- fixed callback problem in make_gate_rate

1.9.95:
-------
- changed initial plot size to 500 to improve speed
- made numerous changes to allow Matlab to compile HHsim:
  * removed all calls to eval and replaced them with str_eval,
    str_feval, str_get, str_set. all these files are generated by
    a script and templates in the str_eval subdirectory.
  * replaced all callbacks accessing variables to either use
    the str_* functions above, or to call callbacks.m
  * replaced exist by code alternatives
  * added function list to run to ensure compilation
  * changed run to be a function
  * removed text output in run
  * changed set_valbox to use function handles, except in a couple of
    special cases where it switches function
  * quick eval replacing switches added to update_gate, since it is
    the main loop
- fixed errors on close while running

1.4.02:
