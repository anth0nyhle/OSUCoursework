% Functions for getting neighbors in 2D kinematics problem
% By Geoff Gordon and Geoff Hollinger, 2007

% Return the neighbors of a given state.  MAP is the map of the environment
% (an array of 1s and 0s denoting occupied and full cells respectively).
% STATE is a vector describing the current state [X Y].  NBRS has one
% row per neighbor (i.e., up to 4 rows).  Each row is the same format as
% STATE, and results from applying a feasible action.  If there are no
% feasible actions from STATE, then NBRS == [].

function [nbrs, num_nbrs] = get_neighbors(map, stateID)

[x,y] = state_from_index(map,stateID);

acts = [0 -1; 1 0; 0 1; -1 0; 0 0];
nbrs = [];
num_nbrs = 0;

for i = 1:size(acts,1)
    ax = acts(i,1);
    ay = acts(i,2);
    %check if this path collides with an obstacle or leaves the map
    if (~check_hit(map, x, y, ax, ay))
        nbrs = [nbrs; index_from_state(map,x+ax,y+ay)];
        num_nbrs = num_nbrs + 1;
