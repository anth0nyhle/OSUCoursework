<h2>Part I:  Equilibrium Potential</h2>

We will first explore the equilibrium potential of a cell with a
single channel type.  Click on the Channels button in the main window
to call up the Channels window.  In the Channels window, turn off the
all the channels <i>except</i> the first one (passive sodium), by
clicking on their respective buttons.  The buttons should change color
to gray when you turn them off.  Notice that the resting potential Vr
displayed in the Membrane window is now equal to the reversal
potential for sodium, 52.4 mV.  A mouse click on the red line will
show you the exact value of Vm.  Vm may not be exactly equal to Vr,
but clicking the yellow <b>Nudge</b> button a few times will nudge
things along until the voltage reaches the theoretical asymptote.  Or
you can click <b>Run</b>, wait a while, and then click
<b>Stop</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
Question 1.  Calculate the effect of halving the external sodium
concentration.  Remember, we're assuming that only sodium channels are
present.  You will first need to calculate RT/zF at 6.3<sup>o</sup>,
which you can do from the information provided in the Membrane window.
Then, confirm your answer in the simulator by changing the
concentration in the Membrane windoww and looking at the new value of
passive Vr.  (You can type new values into any of the boxes in the
Membrane window, or use the <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> buttons to
change the values.)</p>

<li> Question 2.  Calculate the [Na+] external concentration required to
achieve Vr = 55.5 mV.  Confirm your answer using the
simulator.</p>

</ul>

Hit the <b>Reset</b> button in the Membrane window to restore all
parameters to their initial values.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 3.  Suppose we double the temperature from 6.3<sup>o</sup> C to
12.6<sup>o</sup> C.  What is the new value of Vr?  Explain why Vr doesn't
double.
</ul>

<h2> Part II: Membrane Potential</h2>

In exercise we will look at the membrane potential
with only passive channels (no voltage gated sodium or potassium
channels.)  Reset the simulator by typing "run" again in the Matlab
Command Window.  (Don't hit the green <b>Run</b> button; make sure the
simulator is stopped before typing "run" in the Command Window.)</p>

Turn off the yellow and green plots in the main window by selecting
"-" in their respective pulldown menus.  Set the cyan (light blue)
plot to "I_leak", the leakage current.  I_leak is equal to the flow of
current through the passive channels.  By looking above and below the
cyan pulldown menu, you will see that the scale of the I_leak plot
ranges from -0.05 to 0.05 pico-Amp.  Display the Membrane and Channels
windows as well.</p>

In the Channels window, turn off the two voltage gated channels (pink
buttons) so that only the three passive channels (green buttons) are
functional.  Note that the membrane voltage (red line) rises from its
previous level of roughly -62 mv to a new level of around -48 mv.  The
simulator stops when the membrane voltage is close to asymptote.  To
get an exact resting value, click the yellow <b>Nudge</b> button a few
times until the value displayed for Vm stops changing.</p>

The rise in Vm shows that at the normal resting potential, some
voltage-gated channels as well as leak channels were open.  When the
voltage-gated channels are disabled, the only open channels are the
leak channels, and resting membrane voltage rises.  Since membrane
current must be 0 at Vrest, the leak current (blue line) is zero.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 1. Write down the parallel conductance equation for the
resting potential as a function of equilibrium potentials and
conductances.  Given the equilibrium potentials shown in the Membrane
window and the conductances shown in the Channels window, calculate
the resting potential Vr.</p>

<li> Question 2. You can see from the Channels window that gK is 0.070
micro-Siemens.  Calculate to two significant digits the value to which
gK would have to be reduced in order to make Vr be -45 mV.  Verify
your answer by changing the value of gK in the simulator and seeing
how the value of passive Vr in the Membrane window changes.</p>

<li> Question 3. We can also manipulate the resting potential Vr by
changing the ion concentrations.  Obviously it is easier to change the
concentrations outside the cell than inside.  Suppose we want to raise
the cell's resting potential to -39 mv, while maintaining a constant
osmolarity and not disturbing the charge balance.  What ion
concentrations should we change, and what should their new values be?
Use the simulator to find the answer empirically.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Part III: The Action Potential</h2>

Reset the simulator by typing "run" again in the Matlab Command
Window.  Click on the purple <b>Stim1</b> button in the main window to
stimulate the cell and generate a spike.  You can see the stimulus
plotted as a purplish line, while the spike is visible as the membrane
voltage plotted as a red line.  Click on the <b>Stim2</b> button to
apply a hyperpolarizing pulse to the cell.  Notice that this also
results in a spike.</p>

<ul><li>Question 1.  Why does hyperpolarization cause a spike?</p></ul>

Click on the Stimuli button in the main window to call up the Stimulus
Parameters window.  Notice that button <b>Stim1</b> is set up to
provide a 1 millisecond stimulus at +10 nano-amps.  Using the slider
controls, you can add a second pulse to <b>Stim1</b>.  Set up a second
10 nA pulse 5 msec after the first.  (Note: clicking on the slider
changes the value by 5.  Clicking on the arrowheads changes the value
by 1.  You can also type values directly into the box next to each
slider.  Moving the mouse over a slider or text box dispays some
pop-up text explaining its function.)</p>

Notice that two pulses spaced 5 msec apart do not cause two spikes.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 2.  Why doesn't this second pulse cause a second spike?
Phrase your answer in terms of gates and voltages.</p>

<li>
Question 3.  How much time must elapse between the end of the first
pulse and the beginning of the second in order for the second pulse to
cause a second spike?  (Use the simulator to experiment.)</p>
</ul>

A negative pulse occuring soon after a positive pulse can prevent a
spike from occurring.  Set up the <b>Stim1</b> parameters to provide a 5 nA
pulse folowed 1 msec later by a -5 nA pulse.  You'll see that the 1 ms
interval is too long to prevent the spike.  Shorter intervals can be
obtained by typing a fractional value like 0.9 into the text for the
middle horizontal slider.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 4.  To the nearest 10th of a millisecond, what is the
longest delay after a 1 msec 5 nA positive pulse that a 1 msec -5 nA
pulse can block a spike?</p>
</ul>

<h2>Part IV: The Fast Sodium Channel</h2>

Type "run" in the Matlab Command Window to reinitialize the simulator.
Press the <b>Stim1</b> button to stimulate the cell and generate a
spike.  The yellow, green, and cyan (light blue) lines in the upper
plot display the Hodgkin-Huxley variables m, h, and n, respectively.
The variables take on values between 0 and 1.  Recall that the fast
sodium channel conductance is proportional to m<sup>3</sup>h, and
potassium channel activity is proportional to n<sup>4</sup>.</p>

In this exercise we will focus on just the sodium channel, which
consists of an activation gate and an inactivation gate.  Both these
gates must be open in order for current to flow.  The m<sup>3</sup>
term describes the state of the activation gate, and the h term
describes the state of the inactivation gate.  The closer these values
are to 1, the more "open" the gate is.</p>

Using the cyan pop-up menu, set the cyan plot to display g_Na, the
sodium conductance, which is proportional to m<sup>3</sup>h.  The
numbers above and below the yellow, green, and cyan windows represent
the y-axis values of the uppermost and lowest dashed lines,
respectively, in the upper plot.  The range for the cyan plot is now 0
to 30 pico-Siemens.  Click on <b>Zoom In</b> to get a better view, and use
the scroll bar to position the plot as necessary.</p>

As you can see, the inactivation gate variable h (green line) has a
resting value of around 0.5, so it's normally part-way open.  But the
activation gate variable m (yellow line) normally rests close to 0.
This is why the total sodium conductance (cyan line) is close to zero
pico-Siemens at rest.</p>

When a stimulus depolarizes the cell slightly, the activation gate
opens (yellow line "m" rises), the sodium conductance (cyan line)
increases, and the cell depolarizes further (red line Vm rises).
However, as the membrane voltage increases, the inactivation gate
begins to close (green line "h" decreases to zero), and this causes
the overall conductance (cyan line, proportional to m<sup>3</sup>h) to
drop even though the yellow line remains high (activation gate remains
open) for quite a while.</p>

What eventually causes the yellow line to drop is the repolarization
of membrane potential (indicated by the red line dropping) as a result
of opening of voltage dependent potassium channels.  Without the
potassium channels, the cell would remain depolarized.  To demonstrate
this, we will do an experiment.</p>

Call up the Channels window and disable the Delayed Rectifier
(potassium) channel.  There is normally some leakage current through
this channel when the cell is at rest; removing it triggers a spike.
The cell depolarizes but cannot repolarize, because now there is no
active potassium current.  The membrane voltage thus remains high, and
the yellow line stays high.</p>

<ul><li> Question 1.  looking at the simulator output, at what
potential does the cell settle after the spike has subsided, i.e.,
what is the new resting value of Vm?  Click on the red line to measure
the value.</p></ul>

The spike peak is around +50 mV.  With no active potassium channel
conductance, the cell does not fully repolarize, but the membrane
voltage does decline some from the peak value.  Notice that if Vm is
perturbed from its new resting value by a depolarizing or
hyperpolarizing stimulus (try the <b>Stim1</b> and <b>Stim2</b>
buttons) it returns to the new resting value.</p>

The new value of Vm is determined by the conductances of two channel
types: the leak channels (which have conductance to Na, K, and Cl),
and the (not quite fully closed) fast voltage dependent sodium
channels.  Although it may appear that in this state h = 0 and hence
g_Na = 0, they are actually slightly positive.  Because the leakage
conductance is so low, the slight steady-state activation of voltage
gated Na channels still has a large effect on Vrest.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 2.  Using the parallel conductance equation, calculate the
conductance of the fast sodium channel in this new resting condition.</p>

<li>Question 3.  Stimulating the cell again (using the <b>Stim1</b>
button) in this condition will not cause another spike.  Even if you
raise the stimulus intensity to 20 nA and the duration to 10 msec, the
cell will not spike.  (Try it.  Turn off the cyan plot by selecting
"-" in the pop-up menu so you can see the yellow and green plots
clearly when you hit <b>Stim1</b>.)  What is the explanation for this?</p></ul>


<a name=part5>
<h2>Part V: The Delayed Rectifier</h2>

Type "run" in the Matlab Command Window to reset the simulator.  Press
<b>Stim1</b> to stimulate the cell and generate a "normal" spike, for
reference.  Then call up the Channels window, and disable the fast
sodium channel.  The resting potential hyperpolarizes only slightly,
indicating that very few voltage dependent Na channels are open under
normal resting conditions.</p>

Turn off the yellow plot (select "-") in the pop-up menu and set the
green plot to "I_K", the delayed rectifier current.</p>

Call up the Stimulus window and set Stim1 to a 100 nA stimulus lasting
5 msec.  Press the <b>Stim1</b> button in the main simulator window to
depolarize the cell, and see what happens.</p>

<ul><li> Question 1.  Based on the Vm plot (red line), what is the
peak value reached by the membrane voltage?  Click on the line to the
right of the peak, and use the <b>&lt;</b> button to find the maximum.</p>

<li>
Question 2: after reaching its peak, the membrane voltage quickly
declines again, even though the stimulus is still on.  What is causing
this?  Point to some evidence to support your answer.</p>

<li>Question 3: when the stimulus ends, the cell does not simply return to
its resting value; it undershoots it and then approaches the value
from below.  Why doesn't it just return to its resting value?</p></ul>

<h2>Part VI: Voltage-Gated Channel Parameters</h2>

Hodgkin and Huxley explained the behavior of voltage-gated channels in
terms of activation and inactivation gates that opened or closed based
on the membrane voltage.  These "gates" are pieces of channel
structure (i.e., segments of the amino acid chains that make up the
channel) which change their shape or position based on the potential
across the membrane.  The m<sup>3</sup> term in the expression
m<sup>3</sup>h for the fast sodium channel indicates that three
segments of the channel must change their conformation to open the
activation gate, while the h term indicates that only a single piece
of structure controls the inactivation gate.</p>

At the molecular level channel components do not just sit in a fixed
position at temperatures above absolute zero,.  They continually
change their conformation.  However, some conformations are more
likely than others, and therefore occur more frequently.  The channel
characteristics determine which configurations are more likely, as a
function of the current membrane voltage.  The parameter m can be
viewed as the probability that a particular segment of the activation
gate is in the configuration required for the gate to be open.
Alternatively, it can be viewed as the fraction of channels in which
this segment is in the configuration required for the gate to open.
Since all three segments must be in the open position for the
activation gate to be open, and the segments are independent, the
probability that the gate is open (or equivalently, the fraction of
channels with open activation gates) is m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

Type "run" in the Matlab command window to reset the simulator.  Call
up the Channels window, and press the Details button for the fast
sodium channel.  This displays a window showing the parameters
responsible for the behavior of the fast sodium channel.  Looking at
the top of the display, we see that this channel is permeable to the
sodium ion, and that its maximum conductance g_max is 120
mico-Siemens.</p>

<ul><li>
Question 1: how does g_max for the fast sodium channel compare with
the passive sodium conductance?</p></ul>

The left half of the Fast Sodium details window describes the
activation gate, while the right half describes the inactivation gate.
The behavior of an activation gate segment is governed by two rates:
alpha is the rate at which segments move from the closed to the open
state (causing m to increase), while beta is the rate at which they
move from the open to the closed state (causing m to decrease).  Alpha
and beta are determined by exponential functions whose parameters are
shown in the window.  These equations are functions of Vm.  In the
graph at the bottom, alpha is plotted in red, while beta is plotted in
blue.</p>

Looking at this plot, we see that when Vm = -50, alpha is much less
than beta.  That means segments will move from the open to the closed
configuration at a higher rate than they move from closed to open.  As
a result, the net change in m will be a decrease.</p>

<ul><li> Question 2: What relationship must hold between the red and
blue lines for m to increase?  And, what is the approximate value of
Vm at which this condition occurs (if there were no other mechanisms
affecting the cell)?  How does this compare to the cell's normal
resting potential?</p></ul>

Now press <b>Stim1</b> to trigger a spike, which we will use for
reference.</p>

The state of the inactivation gate is indicated by the variable h,
whose parameters are displayed in the right half of the Details
window.  Suppose we want to lengthen the duration of a spike.  We can
do that by slowing down the rate at which the inactivation gate
closes, so that the channel remains open longer.  Beta is the rate at
which the inactivation gate will close.  Change the beta magnitude
parameter (c) from 1.0 to 0.4.  Then press the yellow <b>Nudge</b>
button in the main simulator window a few times.  The cell starts
spiking and doesn't stop.  Press the red <b>Stop</b> button to stop
the simulation.  You should notice several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The spike width is now greater, as we intended.</p>

<li> The green line (h) decreases more slowly during a spike, and does
 not get as close to zero as it did previously.  This is the direct
 consequence of our decreasing the h beta magnitude.</p>

<li> The yellow line (m) stays high for longer.  This is because the
 cell is remaining depolarized longer.  Remember that it is the
 closing of the inactivation gate (h) that cuts off the sodium influx
 and allows the cell to repolarize.  If the gate closes more slowly,
 Vm stays high longer, and hence the activation gate remains open
 longer.<p>

<li> The peak of the spike is higher than before.</p>

</ol>

As you can see, the cell is quite sensitive to parameter changes;
altering a single value produces a complex set of effects.  We may
conclude that the channels governing a cell's behavior form an
exquisitely tuned system.  And here we're only dealing with two
channel types; keep in mind that some cells have a dozen!</p>

<ul><li> Question 3: in order to stop the cell from oscillating on its
own, we can change the passive channel conductance.  Hit the
<b>Run</b> button in the main simulator window to continue the
simulation.  By playing with the value of g_K in the Channels window,
find a value close to the original value of 0.07 micro-Siemens that
prevents the cell from spiking spontaneously.  The cell should of
course still spike in reponse to a stimulus from the <b>Stim1</b>
button.  Report the g_K value you find, to two significant
digits.</p></ul>
