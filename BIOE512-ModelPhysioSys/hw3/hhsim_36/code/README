  1) start up Matlab
  2) cd to the directory holding the source code
  3) type "hhsim"

================================================================

Click on the purple Stim1 or Stim2 buttons to inject a depolarizing or
hyperpolarizing current stimulus.  Click on the Membrane, Channels, 
Stimuli or Drugs buttons to view and modify the simulation parameters.

This program was inspired by earlier BASIC and C programs by Professor
David Wood, and lecture notes by Professor Bard Ermentrout, both at
the University of Pittsburgh.  Thanks to Professor Jon Johnson at the
University of Pittsburgh for many helpful suggestions for improving
the user interface.
